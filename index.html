            <p>Donating to the causes you care about not only benefits the charities themselves, it can be deeply rewarding for you too. Millions of people give to charity on a regular basis to support causes they believe in, as well as for the positive effect it has on their own lives.

                    <p>Unknown to most people, there are more health and safety risks to flood victims than drowning. Flood victims are also susceptible to injuries related to being swept and hit by objects. 
                        
                        Floods can destroy properties and cars but that is unavoidable. Additionally, losing many possessions to a flood adds financial strains to families. Make sure you donate to reputable organizations that will bring your donations over to the affected site. Some necessities you can donate are food, water, clothing and etc.</p>
